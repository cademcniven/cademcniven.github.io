                <p>November 25, 2020</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>If you aren&#39;t already aware, i+1 is defined as:</p>
                <blockquote><p>If <em>i</em> represents previously acquired
                        linguistic
                        competence and extra-linguistic knowledge, the
                        hypothesis claims
                        that we move from <em>i</em> to <em>i+1</em> by
                        understanding
                        input that contains <em>i+1</em>. Extra-linguistic
                        knowledge
                        includes our knowledge of the world and of the
                        situation, that
                        is, the <a

                        The <em>+1</em> represents &#39;the next increment&#39;
                        of new
                        knowledge or language structure that will be within the
                        learner&#39;s capacity to acquire.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>This idea is one of the cornerstones of <a
                        href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiTsduRreug'>input-based
                        learning</a>. While the above definition is written in
                    typical
                    academic language, in the Japanese learning community (AJATT
                    in
                    particular) it&#39;s defined more simply as, &quot;a
                    sentence that
                    contains exactly one unknown word.&quot; This definition has
                    worked
                    just fine so far and it has enabled the typical AJATT
                    workflow:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Immerse in native content.</li>
                    <li>When you find a sentence with exactly one unknown word,
                        make a
                        flashcard for it.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>Generally, rather than waste time trying to optimize your
                    flashcard
                    setup, it would be recommended to just go immerse more...</p>
                <p>Ignoring that advice, let&#39;s continue to over-analyze i+1
                    into
                    oblivion.</p>
                <p>A while back I was browsing through Discord and came across
                    an
                    interesting message by <code>neb#5424</code>:</p>
                <blockquote><p>I just find that a lot of people think i + 1 is
                        one extra
                        new vocab, when the &quot;i&quot; should ideally be
                        things you
                        know close to second nature. Those cards are always easy
                        to
                        absorb.. the ones that has half understood grammar, new
                        kanji,
                        vague sentence meanings, those cards are exponentially
                        hard.
                        it&#39;s deceptive not i + 1. Anyways, do keep an eye
                        out for
                        them. I wasted a lot of time myself battling those
                        cards.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This idea really stuck out to me, and I think it&#39;s truer
                    to the
                    actual definition of i+1 than the typical AJATT definition
                    is. In
                    fact, it also is more true to the traditionally prescribed
                    &quot;patterns&quot; of SRS use.</p>
                <p>In the legendary article <a
                        href='http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html'>Augmenting
                        Long-term Memory</a>, Michael Nielsen gives the advice:</p>
                <blockquote><p><strong>Make most Anki questions and answers as
                            atomic as
                            possible:</strong> That is, both the question and
                        answer
                        express just one idea. As an example, when I was
                        learning the
                        Unix command line, I entered the question: “How to
                        create a soft
                        link from <code>linkname</code> to <code>filename</code>?”
                        The
                        answer was: “<code>ln -s filename linkname</code>”.
                        Unfortunately, I routinely got this question wrong.</p>
                    <p>The solution was to refactor the question by breaking it
                        into two
                        pieces. One piece was: “What&#39;s the basic command and
                        option
                        to create a Unix soft link?” Answer: “<code>ln -s …</code>”.
                        And
                        the second piece was: “When creating a Unix soft link,
                        in what
                        order do <code>linkname</code> and <code>filename</code>
                        go?”
                        Answer: “<code>filename linkname</code>”. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>If you&#39;ve spent any amount of time in <a
                        href='https://www.reddit.com/r/anki'>r/anki</a>
                    you&#39;re
                    probably already sick of hearing this advice for the
                    millionth time.
                    However, for whatever reason, this advice hasn&#39;t seem to
                    have
                    made it to the Japanese learning community (despite the
                    overwhelming
                    use of Anki).</p>
                <p>I believe the reason for this is that people want to either:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Do as little Anki as possible, or</li>
                    <li>Maximize the number of new words learned per day</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The consequence of either option is that people end up with
                    cards
                    that aren&#39;t even close to i+1. Learning the same amount
                    of
                    information per day with atomic cards would result in <em>vastly</em>
                    more reviews per day. Let&#39;s consider what things could
                    represent
                    the <code>1</code> in <code>i+1</code>.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>An unknown word (in hiragana or katakana)</li>
                    <li>An unknown kanji</li>
                    <li>An unknown meaning (of a kanjified word)</li>
                    <li>An unknown reading (of a kanjified word)</li>
                    <li>An unknown grammar point</li>

                </ol>
                <p>If you broke up your cards so that they contained only one
                    instance
                    of anything on that list, it would take an incredible number
                    of
                    cards (as opposed to how most people currently do things).
                    The
                    question is, is it worth it?</p>
                <p>I&#39;ve been experimenting with this idea for close to 2
                    months now
                    with the following setup:</p>
                <p>For learning to recognize kanji, and get an understanding of
                    their
                    meaning, I use Jo-Mako&#39;s kanji deck.</p>
                <p><img
                        src="images\20201125\kanji.png"
                        referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="kanji"></p>
                <p>I only create cards that use vocabulary from kanji that
                    I&#39;ve
                    already learned from this deck.</p>
                <p>For every sentence, my custom note type will generate 2
                    cards: one
                    for testing reading, one for testing meaning.</p>
                <p><img
                        src="images\20201125\meaning.png"
                        referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="meaning"></p>
                <p>For meaning cards, the target word is highlighted in red.</p>
                <p><img
                        src="images\20201125\reading.png"
                        referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="reading"></p>
                <p>For reading cards, the target word is highlighted in yellow.</p>
                <p><img
                        src="images\20201125\back.png"
                        referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="back"></p>
                <p>The back looks the same for both.</p>
                <p>If you&#39;re interested, the highlighting effect is achieved
                    using
                    the following bit of javascript:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
var word = document.getElementById(&#39;word&#39;);
var sentence = document.getElementById(&#39;sentence&#39;);

var w = word.innerHTML;
sentence.innerHTML = sentence.innerHTML.replace(w, &#39;&lt;span class=&quot;highlightReading&quot;&gt;&#39; + w + &#39;&lt;/span&gt;&#39;);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
                <p>The sentence itself doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be i+1
                    since
                    I&#39;m not testing myself on the sentence (although I do
                    listen to
                    the full sentence audio on the back of every card). For a
                    bit of
                    justification of this kind of card (as opposed to a regular
                    sentence
                    card), see <a
                        href='https://web.archive.org/web/20200523121931/https://www.animecards.site/'>animecards.site</a></p>
                <p>Finally, I learn grammar points from the <a
                        href='https://dojgdeck.neocities.org/'>DoJG deck</a>.</p>
                <p><img
                        src="images\20201125\dojg.png"
                        referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="dojg"></p>
                <p>So in total the routine is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>10 cards a day for grammar (this only covers 2 grammar
                        points,
                        the rest of the cards are sentence cards that use that
                        grammar
                        point in order to reinforce it)</li>
                    <li>10 cards a day for kanji</li>
                    <li>A variable number of reading/meaning cards per day
                        depending on
                        how many I mine (30-40 total on average)</li>

                </ol>
                <p>If that sounds like a lot, well, it absolutely is. My reviews
                    are
                    typically 400-500 per day, which takes a total of around 1.5
                    hours.
                    <em>However</em> before you completely dismiss this sort of
                    approach
                    as insane and/or unsustainable, there are a couple things to
                    consider.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Yes, this sort of schedule is pretty much ridiculous,
                        but it
                        happens to fit into my schedule right now. I will
                        absolutely
                        have to massively adjust things in the future when I
                        have less
                        time on my hands.</li>
                    <li>A huge chuck of my Anki time comes from those 10 grammar
                        cards a
                        day, which is because I&#39;m creating my own grammar
                        deck
                        (which I build during my reviews).</li>
                    <li>Most people doing some flavor of AJATT do Recognition
                        RTK
                        (RRTK), which entails doing a kanji deck in isolation
                        before any
                        kind of vocabulary study. By doing kanji study and
                        vocabulary in
                        parallel, I&#39;m massively adding to the time spent per
                        day in
                        Anki.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>Therefore, a much more realistic setup would be:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>20-40 mined cards a day (remember that the total
                        &#39;words&#39;
                        is half of that since it&#39;s 2 cards per note)</li>
                    <li>5 grammar cards per day</li>

                </ol>
                <p>Because of the sheer speed of reviewing cards like these (as
                    opposed
                    to regular sentence cards), you can get away with such a
                    high number
                    of new cards per day while keeping your Anki time under an
                    hour.</p>
                <p>But enough of me justifying my absurd study habits, let&#39;s
                    get
                    back to the actual question this experiment was trying to
                    answer:</p>
                <p><strong>Does this lead to better results than traditional
                        sentence
                        cards?</strong></p>
                <p>And my answer to that is... sort of? </p>
                <p>It&#39;s hard to argue with the results of sentence cards, as
                    many
                    people have used them (along side thousands of hours of
                    immersion)
                    to achieve high levels of language mastery. On the other
                    hand, cards
                    in this style have yet to prove themselves to such a high
                    level.</p>
                <p>From my 2 months of use (contrasting with about 2 months of
                    sentence
                    cards before that), I&#39;ve found these cards much more
                    enjoyable
                    to review. This is because they naturally grant a higher
                    retention
                    rate, as well as being way faster to review.</p>
                <p>The downside, of course, is that they require twice the
                    number of
                    cards for the same result. So, even though the review time
                    per card
                    is reduced, the total time spent in Anki ends up being about
                    the
                    same.</p>
                <p>However, if the review time is the same, and these cards are
                    more
                    enjoyable to review, in my opinion that makes them worth
                    doing
                    (given that they result in the same quality of learning).
                </p>
                <p>The biggest downside to cards of this style is that they
                    don&#39;t
                    give as much practice with reading full sentences. That
                    said, that
                    issue is ameliorated by the following points:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I listen to the full sentence audio on the back of every
                        card.</li>
                    <li>I get practice reading full sentences from the grammar
                        cards.</li>
                    <li><strong>I immerse.</strong></li>

                </ol>
                <p>The question could be raised, <em>rather than this weird new
                        note
                        type, why not just apply these i+1 principles to regular
                        sentence cards?</em></p>
                <p>The answer to this is, you absolutely could. I would even
                    recommend
                    doing it, given that you have the ability to do so. The main
                    reason
                    I don&#39;t (aside from enjoying this review process
                    better), is
                    that I don&#39;t have a good source to mine <strong>true</strong>
                    i+1 sentences reliably and quickly. Remember that each of
                    these
                    sentences are manually mined, which takes time. Mining 20
                    true i+1
                    cards every day could end up being unrealistic or even
                    become a
                    stressor.</p>
                <p>As for where I mine sentences currently? I&#39;ll be making
                    another
                    post about that later.</p>
                <p>Anyways, I feel like this post has sort of shifted topics
                    from what
                    i+1 really means to me defending my own unorthodox way of
                    studying
                    new words. Regardless, expect similar chaotic brain-dumps
                    from me in
                    the future.</p>
