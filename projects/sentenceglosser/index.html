<hr>
<p>A website that provides a gloss of a japense sentence, designed to be embedded into Anki cards.</p>
<p><img src="/images/sentenceglosser/demo.gif" alt="demo"></p>
<h2>How To Use</h2>
<p>Add the following line to your note:</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt;embed src=https://cademcniven.com/gloss.html?query={{sentence}} style="width: 100%; height:100%; min-height: 350px;"></code></pre>
<p>replace <code>{{sentence}}</code> with whatever your field is called. Also feel free to adjust the height and width if you experience any issues with that.</p>
<h2>Changing Background Color</h2>
<p>You can also change the background color to match the style of your card. To do this, you'll need to add <code>&amp;color=</code> to your embed src like so:</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt;embed src=https://cademcniven.com/gloss.html?query={{sentence}}&amp;color=white style="width: 100%; height:100%; min-height: 350px;"></code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> hex color values are <strong>not</strong> supported. You either need to specify an web-compliant color name, or convert your hex to rgb like this:</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt;embed src=https://cademcniven.com/gloss.html?query={{sentence}}&amp;color=rgb(12,34,56) style="width: 100%; height:100%; min-height: 350px;"></code></pre>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>This is very much a WIP so don't expect it to be perfect, but I think even as it currently is it's very usable. I'll continue working on it in the future which might fix things, or might make them worse, idk.</p>
<p>As with any other auto-generated info, don't blindly trust the furigana -- it's often correct, but not perfect. Also, the tokenization (that is, how it chooses to break up words) is decent but also not perfect, and there's not much I can do about that.</p>
<p>Feel free to let me know if you notice any serious issues and I'll try to fix it.</p>
